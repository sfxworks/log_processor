{"Implementation approach":"We will use Docker to containerize the application and Python for the main logic. For log processing, we will use the built-in logging module. To chunk logs into 32k token sizes, we will use the tiktoken library from OpenAI. For sending logs to an OpenAI compatible endpoint, we will use the openai library. To ensure data security, we will use SSL/TLS encryption for transmission.","File list":["main.py","log_processor.py","openai_client.py","docker-compose.yml"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        +main()\n    }\n    class LogProcessor {\n        +process_logs(logs: str)\n        +chunk_logs(logs: str) list\n    }\n    class OpenAIClient {\n        +send_logs(chunked_logs: list)\n    }\n    Main --> LogProcessor\n    LogProcessor --> OpenAIClient\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant LP as LogProcessor\n    participant OC as OpenAIClient\n    M->>LP: process_logs(logs)\n    LP->>LP: chunk_logs(logs)\n    LP-->>M: return chunked_logs\n    M->>OC: send_logs(chunked_logs)\n    OC-->>M: return response\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The requirement does not specify the format of the container logs or the expected output from the OpenAI endpoint.
