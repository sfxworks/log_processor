## Original Requirements

Write me a python docker app that takes container logs, chunks them up in to 32k token sizes, and sends them away for processing to an openai compatible endpoint

## Project Name

log_processor

## Product Goals

- Efficiently process and analyze container logs
- Ensure data integrity and security during transmission
- Provide accurate and timely results

## User Stories

- As a system administrator, I want to be able to analyze container logs to troubleshoot issues
- As a security analyst, I want to process container logs for threat detection
- As a developer, I want to use the processed logs for application insights

## Competitive Analysis

- Loggly: Offers log management and analysis, but lacks integration with OpenAI
- Splunk: Provides comprehensive log management and analysis, but has a steep learning curve
- ELK Stack: Open-source log management solution, but requires manual setup and maintenance

## Requirement Analysis

The main requirement is to create a Python Docker application that processes container logs, chunks them into 32k token sizes, and sends them to an OpenAI compatible endpoint. Additional requirements may include handling different log formats, ensuring data security, and providing real-time analysis.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop a Python Docker application that processes container logs']
- ['P0', 'Chunk container logs into 32k token sizes']
- ['P0', 'Send chunked logs to an OpenAI compatible endpoint']
- ['P1', 'Handle different log formats']
- ['P1', 'Ensure data security during transmission']

## UI Design draft

A simple command-line interface for starting and stopping the Docker application, with options for configuring log sources and OpenAI endpoint.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement does not specify the format of the container logs or the expected output from the OpenAI endpoint. Clarification may be needed to ensure accurate implementation.
