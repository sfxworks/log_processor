## Implementation approach

We will use Docker to containerize the application and Python for the main logic. For log processing, we will use the built-in logging module. To chunk logs into 32k token sizes, we will use the tiktoken library from OpenAI. For sending logs to an OpenAI compatible endpoint, we will use the openai library. To ensure data security, we will use SSL/TLS encryption for transmission.

## File list

- main.py
- log_processor.py
- openai_client.py
- docker-compose.yml

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class Main {
        +main()
    }
    class LogProcessor {
        +process_logs(logs: str)
        +chunk_logs(logs: str) list
    }
    class OpenAIClient {
        +send_logs(chunked_logs: list)
    }
    Main --> LogProcessor
    LogProcessor --> OpenAIClient


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant LP as LogProcessor
    participant OC as OpenAIClient
    M->>LP: process_logs(logs)
    LP->>LP: chunk_logs(logs)
    LP-->>M: return chunked_logs
    M->>OC: send_logs(chunked_logs)
    OC-->>M: return response


## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement does not specify the format of the container logs or the expected output from the OpenAI endpoint. Clarification may be needed to ensure accurate implementation.
